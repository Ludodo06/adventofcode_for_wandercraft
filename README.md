# Advent of Code — Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code challenges. Each day has a small folder with the puzzle statement, input files and one or two Python solution scripts.

**How to use**
- Each day is in a folder named `day-XX-Name/`.
- Puzzle inputs are in `input.txt` and `input-test.txt` inside each day folder.
- Solutions are in `solution-01.py` and `solution-02.py` (part 1 and part 2 respectively).
- Run a solution with Python, for example:

```
python day-01-SecretEntrance/solution-01.py
```

**Repository structure (short)**
- `day-01-SecretEntrance/`
- `day-02-GiftShop/`
- `day-03-Lobby/`
- `day-04-PrintingDepartment/`

**Answers**

| Day | Name | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | SecretEntrance | <span title="1055">•••</span> | <span title="6386">•••</span> |
| 2 | GiftShop | <span title="23701357374">•••</span> | <span title="34284458938">•••</span> |
| 3 | Lobby | <span title="17554">•••</span> | <span title="175053592950232">•••</span> |
| 4 | PrintingDepartment | <span title="1569">•••</span> | <span title="9280">•••</span> |

**Notes**
- The solutions are plain Python scripts that read `input.txt` from their folder by default. If you change the input file location, update the script call accordingly.
- If you'd like, I can add a small runner script to execute all solutions and populate this README automatically.
